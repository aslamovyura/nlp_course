Sputtering is a type of physical vapor deposition (PVD) which is a very common method for the deposition of thin films. The P5000 sputtering system is based on the principle of electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) which can be used to produce large-area, uniform, and conformal deposition of metal films. The P5000 is based on the principle of electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) which is the principle of ionization on the surface of a gas. It helps to develop thin films of metals and alloys like aluminum, titanium, titanium alloys, zirconium, zirconium alloys, tantalum, tungsten and their alloys. For deposition of metal films, the P5000 uses ECR to ionize the argon gas. The ionized gas is then used for sputtering the substrate.\n",

      "In short, the basic principle of the P5000 is that high-frequency radio waves and plasma in a low-pressure chamber and the system generates a magnetic field near the chamber that makes the electrons from a power source collide with the positive ions present in the plasma to generate a plasma. The P5000 is primarily intended to deposit thin films of metals and alloys of Al, Ti, Zr, Ta, and TIA.\n",
